👋 Hi, I’m @Star-V-06, an 18 y/o tech enthusiast, currently pursuing Bachelors in Data Science from IIT Madras

👀 I like finding fun in everything from studying to music and from simple evening walks to mind-boggling projects 

🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, exploring new technologies, and mysterious of the universe

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that mix creativity, technology, and a zest for life

⚡ I love reading books......from autobiographies to philosophy, from physics books to sci-fi and from fiction to universe mysteries.

✨ #Fun fact - Back then I finished the whole book series of percy Jackson and the heroes of olympus within a month after my 10th boards
